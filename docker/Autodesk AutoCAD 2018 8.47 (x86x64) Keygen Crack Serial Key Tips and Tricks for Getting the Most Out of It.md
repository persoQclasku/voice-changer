Nea Marin Miliardar is a film that will make you laugh out loud and appreciate the talent and charisma of Amza Pellea, one of the greatest Romanian actors of all time. Don't miss this opportunity to enjoy a masterpiece of Romanian cinema!
  
Amza Pellea was born on 7 April 1931 in BÄileÈti, Dolj County, in the historical region of Oltenia. He showed an early interest in acting and joined the local amateur theater group. He graduated from the Carol I High School in Craiova and then enrolled at the Academy of Theatre and Film in Bucharest, where he studied under renowned professors such as Ion Sava and Ion FinteÈteanu.
 
He made his debut on stage in 1955 at the Craiova Theatre, where he played various roles until 1961. He then moved to Bucharest and joined several prestigious theaters, such as the Small Theatre, the Nottara Theatre, the Comedy Theatre and the National Theatre. He also became a professor at his alma mater and taught acting to many young talents. He was admired by his colleagues and students for his professionalism, dedication and generosity.
 
He started his film career in 1961 with a small role in Thirst, directed by SiniÈa Dragin. He soon rose to fame with his portrayals of Romanian national heroes, such as Decebalus in Dacii (1967) and Columna (1968), Michael the Brave in Mihai Viteazul (1971) and VladicÄ Hariton in Tudor din Vladimiri (1976). He also played memorable characters in other genres, such as the rebellious peasant Gheorghe in The Uprising (1966), the ruthless colonel Dumitrescu in The Last Cartridge (1973), the tormented writer Grigore Vieru in The Doom (1976) and the circus performer Mihail in Mihail, cÃ¢ine de circ (1979).
 
However, his most popular role was that of Nea Marin, a humorous and naive Oltenian peasant who often gets into trouble because of his lack of sophistication. The character first appeared on television sketches written by Eugen Barbu and Nicolae Paul Mihail. Pellea improvised many of his lines and added his own touch of wit and charm. The character was so successful that he was adapted to the big screen in Nea Marin miliardar (1979), a comedy directed by Sergiu Nicolaescu. In this film, Pellea played a double role: Nea Marin and J.D. Rockefeller III, an American billionaire who looks exactly like him. The film was a huge hit and became the most viewed Romanian film of all time.
